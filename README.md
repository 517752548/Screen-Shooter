Please note: There is currently a known bug within Unity itself preventing "Screen space - Overlay" UI items from being captured. Once Unity's Developers fix this bug UI elements should be captured correctly. As a workaround you can switch canvas render mode to "Screen Space - Camera" and set canvas plane distance close to camera near clipping plane.
