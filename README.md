# Screen-Shooter

ScreenShooter allows you to take multiple screenshots at different resolutions with just one click, right from the Unity editor.

Features:
* Take multiple screenshots at multiple resolutions with a single click
* Quickly create good high quality screenshots or wallpapers
* Easily create all required screenshots for App Store or Google Play (presets included)
* Add or remove resolutions with ease and save them for later use.
* Take screenshots using any available camera


Please note: There is currently a known bug within Unity itself preventing "Screen space - Overlay" UI items from being captured. Once Unity's Developers fix this bug UI elements should be captured correctly. As a workaround you can switch canvas render mode to "Screen Space - Camera" and set canvas plane distance close to camera near clipping plane.
